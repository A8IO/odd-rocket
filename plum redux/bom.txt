1x led resistor - https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Metal-Film-Resistor-TH_510R-5100-1_C58675.html

Note:
1) use of the 3u keycaps will require the stabilizers and omission of the 2 adjacent switches
2) for custom layouts, a second set of PLUM keycaps is recommended, but alternate keycaps should work (spacing will be off)
3) the teensy 2.0 needs to be mounted underneath the pcb for clearance, reset button pointed down
4) the optional parts are for re-use of the stock usb cable and caps lock led
  for the cable, check the lines with multimeter as the color codes on mine were wrong
  for the led, re-use the spacer for correct placement, I used 510 ohms, 470 should be okay
    make sure to connect the led teensy pin separately if using sockets/header pins
